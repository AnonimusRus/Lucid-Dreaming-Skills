##### Please pay attention to this entire text.  
To begin and advance your practice of dream lucidity, we urge you to metodically follow these three [routines](http://www.dreamviews.com/induction-techniques/61802-naiyas-dild-wild-secrets.html#post850574): one for daytime, bedtime and waking each. Practice includes: training your awareness during the day; keeping a dream journal; day rewatch; stable and ideally biphasic sleep-wake cycle; and performing **SSILD** in the morning. All of these are explained further.  
[SSILD](http://cosmiciron.blogspot.ru/2013/01/senses-initiated-lucid-dream-ssild_16.html) is a modern lucid dreaming technique. It is easy to learn, highly effective, and produces consistent results over period.

### 1) Daytime routine
1. Perform reality checks. Example: check the appearance of your hand, it could be unusual. Most importantly, exercise doubt in the reality of ongoing events.[^1]
2. Make a plan for the case of becoming lucid, both think of a to-do and visualize intense experience. 
3. Train your memory, attention and awareness, don't act automatically, try to be more lucid in your waking life. 

### 2) Bedtime routine:  
1. Reread your dream journal's content on this and previous nights.
2. Perform day rewatch in three steps: 1) recall the events in any order you can (takes 10 min. or so); fast-forward the day-movie in a chronological order; repeat the most meaningful moments. Then, stop thinking about the day. 
3. Recall your plan for a lucid dream. Obligatory first part: to stabilize your perception and spirit inside the dream-world. 
4. Calm down and relax (autogenic training or something like that is good), fall asleep.[^2] 

### 3) Lucidity routine – ATTENTION, SSILD

1.  Wake up in 3-4 sleep cycles (4,5-6 hours, better 6). Alarm is OK to use. Write down your dreams. Better to make haste, so keep your journal readily accessible. At least write down some tags right after you wake up (first take a moment to recollect it in your head, though – but don't fall back asleep).[^3] Drink water etc., after 5-10 minutes of waking return to bed.
2. Relax (no techniques needed), remember your LD plan (1 minute). 
3. Perform «fast cycles set»:  
	- Focus on Sight: Close your relaxed eyes and pay attention to the darkness behind your eyelids. 
	- Focus on Hearing: Further relax your eyes and shift your attention to your ears to hear any internal and phantom noise. 
	- Focus on Somesthetic Senses (Touch): Direct your attention to your body to find unusual sensations – tingling, heaviness, lightness, spinning sensations; the weight of the blanket, your heartbeat, temperature of the air, etc. are secondary "targets". 
It's totally fine to not see, hear or feel anything extraordinary, also don't try to create the sensations. Stay relaxed, but go through the cycles quickly – roughly 7 seconds per sensation, 20 per cycle, 6 cycles in total, 2 minutes for set.[^4]

4. Perform «slow cycles set»:
Same but slower. 10 seconds per sensation, 30 per cycle, 4 cycles, 2 minutes.[^4]  
5.  Calmly fall asleep.
6. **Attain dream lucidity**, likely in one of the following ways:  
	-  Spontaneously become lucid in a concurrent dream;
	-  Find yourself in a mixed state and separate from real bodily sensations;
	-  False awakening (don't forget to do a reality check!);  
	-  Fast true awakening (fall into lucid dream directly).  
	
	6.1 In cases of both mixed state and falling asleep after true awakening, you need to get «deeper» into the dream, by concentrating on **phantom sensations**. Use either the 20-second cycles you already know, or [FILD](http://www.dreamviews.com/induction-techniques/4779-finger-induced-lucid-dream-fild.html "Finger Induced Lucid Dream") technique – essentially, just press alternately with your index and middle finger on 2 imaginary keys, but don't make an actual movement, keep it on the brink of happening; be calm; concentrate on this feeling and nothing else. After some time do a reality check, you might be lucid. It's **strongly** advised to practice this during the day. 
7. In your LD you find some balance of attention, activity and intense perceptions (move, examine textures by seeing and touch, mind your vestibular sense etc.) to stabilize the dream.[^5]  
8. All that's left is to wake, recall and write down your dream.[^3] 

These three routines are **more than enough** to start. Performing them seriously, you'll get results quite fast, both in the form of intentional LDs and in other benefits such as random LDs at night, better and brighter dreams with easier recall, more thoughtful and  productive mind during the day. 
And that's the start.[^6] Good luck and good night. 

*Notes:*
[^1]: The truly important thing is the doubt, not the specific check: imagine yourself patting your empty pocket thinking "where's my wallet?!", imagine the chill; this rapid agitation is what you should train. Perform it as often as possible, but do not rely on a specific check more than 6-8 times a day, or else it'll become an empty ritual. 

[^2]: 300mg of glycine at bedtime is good for your dreams.  To promptly correct your sleep-wake cycle, take 0.5mg (1/6 of a typical tablet!) of melatonin 20 minutes prior to desired sleep onset, and then go to bed avoiding any illumination. 

[^3]: Dream journal should be pleasant for you, associated with wonder and not boredom; pick the notebook and pen accordingly. In the final dream record, you should include: date, time of sleep onset; date, time of recording; the drugs affecting your sleep; the entire dream story; peculiarities of waking; lucid dreaming technique; results. Pay special attention to: most emotional and awe-inspiring moments; perceptual vividness of dream and LD; degree of lucidity; deviations from the plan. Also recognize bits from prior waking. 

[^4]: Precision isn't needed, you absolutely mustn't count seconds, even the order of sensations in the cycle and the number or cycles are not obligatory. Still, this is the general scheme. 

[^5]: The issue of stabilization and prolonging the lucid dream will be elaborated on in *Tutorial: part 2 «aspects of lucidity»*. Then we'll move to *Tutorial: part 3 «advanced lucidity»*.
